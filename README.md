Time-Series-Analysis
====================
Some R scripts of examples from Durbin & Koopman's text

=======
Durbin & Koopman's [Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Analysis-State-Space-Methods/dp/019964117X) has some illustrations that I figured would be useful to investigate for learning the material. The data files needed for processing can be found at [this website](http://www.ssfpack.com/DKbook.html) (it's not my data, so I'm not going to keep it on hand).

The authors do not seem to provide any code in the text, so I figured that [R](https://www.r-project.org/) would be a good choice for learning the material in a computational manner. Most of the files here are not really production-use, just understanding the algorithms used in the text.
